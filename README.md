# Study Buddy – Smart Academic Assistant 💬🎓

**Study Buddy** is an interactive demo developed as part of an **internal hackathon at HIT College in collaboration with AWS**. The project showcases a concept for a smart academic assistant — a chatbot that detects declines in student performance and offers personalized support.

The system includes a complete UI simulation, conversation scenarios, and animated transitions. The demo was built using React and modern web technologies, simulating how AWS tools can be integrated for analysis, monitoring, and academic support.

## 🔧 Technologies Used

### 🧠 AWS Technologies (learned and theoretically integrated):
- **Amazon S3** – for storing files (videos, transcripts, recordings)
- **Amazon Transcribe** – for converting lecture recordings to text
- **Amazon Bedrock** – for analyzing and summarizing texts using models like Claude
- **Lambda** – for running serverless functions
- **EventBridge + DynamoDB + Lex** – for event handling, data storage, and conversation processing

### 👨‍💻 Front-End Technologies in the Demo:
- **React** (via CDN)
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**
- **Tailwind CSS** – for responsive and clean design
- **HTML/CSS** – for structure and styling
- **Babel** – for running JSX directly in the browser

---

## 📺 Project Deliverables
- **study_buddy.html** – Full HTML file with all code needed to run the demo
- **Study Buddy Project Presentation.pdf** – Project presentation explaining the concept, solution, and technologies
- **video_study_buddy.mp4** – Short demo video showcasing the bot

## 🚀 How to Run the Demo
1. Download the `study_buddy.html` file
2. Open it in a modern browser (Chrome/Edge recommended)
3. Experience the questionnaire, interactive chat, and animations

> ⚠️ Note: This is a **front-end only demo** — it is not connected to live AWS services. It demonstrates how a smart assistant *could* look and function.

## 👥 Project Team
This project was developed by a team of students for the HIT internal hackathon. Each member contributed to different aspects — concept design, UI/UX, development, and technical architecture. I, Nicole Davidov, participated fully in building, coding, and presenting the demo.

## 💡 Core Concept
To detect in real-time when a student’s academic performance drops by analyzing grades, attendance, and personal data — and to offer tailored solutions like lecture summaries, advisor referrals, study reminders, and video resources.

## 📌 Final Notes
- Carefully built for an internal academic hackathon — not a final product
- Can serve as a solid foundation for future AWS-based academic tools
